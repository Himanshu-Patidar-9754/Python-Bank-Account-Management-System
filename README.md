# 🏦 Python Banking System

🔧 Project Description
I’ve built a console-based banking system in Python that simulates key functionalities of real-world banking. The application allows users to securely create and manage bank accounts, perform transactions, and generate detailed reports based on activity. It focuses on modularity, clarity, and practical application — ideal for beginner-to-intermediate Python learners who want to understand file handling, logical flow, and data analysis.
